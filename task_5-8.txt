(5) explain some of the ways hashing functions enable blockchain technology
- hashing transactions and blocks

(6) briefly explain Bitcoin's UTXO model of transaction validation (separate from POW)
null

(7) what is the structure of a Block in bitcoin and how does it relate to the 'blockchain' (merkle tree vs merkle list of merkle trees)
merkle tree - allows you to verify transactions in a block using hashing

(8) what problem/sure POW/POS trying to solve? discuss/compare (byzantine fault tolerance, reaching a single consensus on a p2p network
Pow/pos are needed to prevent ddos attacks on the network by blocks, and to regulate block rewards.
Pow:
- high consumption of electric energy
- hacking requires capturing 51% of the network
Pos:
- hacking requires the capture of 51% of funds
